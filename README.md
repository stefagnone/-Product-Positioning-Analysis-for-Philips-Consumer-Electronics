## Project Overview
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive market and consumer analysis for Philips Consumer Electronics to support the positioning of a new product, referred to as "Product X." The analysis focused on understanding the competitive landscape, identifying key competitors, and uncovering consumer perceptions and needs related to similar products. The ultimate goal was to provide Philips with actionable insights for strategically positioning Product X in a competitive market.

The analysis involved:
- Conducting a competitor analysis to assess similar products and market trends.
- Designing and implementing a consumer survey to capture attitudes, needs, and perceptions.
- Analyzing survey data to identify the primary factors influencing purchasing decisions.

This project highlights skills in market research, consumer behavior analysis, and competitive positioning.
